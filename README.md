autoupdate-zsh-plugin
====================

[oh-my-zsh plugin](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for auto updating of git-repositories in $ZSH_CUSTOM folder

## Install

Create a new directory in `~ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins` called `autoupdate` and clone this repo into that directory. Note: it must be named `autoupdate` or oh-my-zsh won't recognize that it is a valid plugin directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/TamCore/autoupdate-oh-my-zsh-plugins ~ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/autoupdate
```

## Usage

Add `autoupdate` to the `plugins=()` list in your `~/.zshrc` file and you're done.
The updates will be executed automatically as soon as the oh-my-zsh updater is started.

If you want to check for updates more often, you can adjust this line in the `~/.zshrc` file. 
Default command:
```shell
# Uncomment the following line to change how often to auto-update (in days).
# export UPDATE_ZSH_DAYS=13
```
Changed command: (checks daily for updates)
```shell
# Uncomment the following line to change how often to auto-update (in days).
export UPDATE_ZSH_DAYS=1
```
